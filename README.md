# FYS3150
Repository with the projects from FYS3150 at UiO done by Maria Lunde Oftedahl and Karianne Strand.

## Project 1

The topic of the first [project](https://github.com/mariaoftedahl/FYS3150/tree/main/Project_1) is numerical solution of the one-dimensional Poisson equation. 

## Project 2

The topic of the second [project](https://github.com/mariaoftedahl/FYS3150/tree/main/Project_2) is solving eigenvalue problems, using the Jacobi rotation method. 

## Project 3

In the third [project](https://github.com/mariaoftedahl/FYS3150/tree/main/Project_3) we made a numerical simulation of a Penning trap, using the Runge-Kutta 4 method to solve a system of ordinary differential equations for the Penning trap.

## Project 4

In [project 4](https://github.com/mariaoftedahl/FYS3150/tree/main/Project_4) we have used the Metropolis algorithm to implement the Ising model in two dimensions. The code is parallelized with OpenMP to be able to run the code with enough Monte Carlo cycles, and big enough lattice, to investigate phase transitions.

## Project 5

In [project 5](https://github.com/mariaoftedahl/FYS3150/tree/main/Project_5) we have used the Crank Nicolson method to solve the Schr√∂dinger equation in two spatial and one time dimension. The solution was then used to try to simulate results from the Double Slit experiment.
