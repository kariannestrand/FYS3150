# FYS3150
Repository with the projects from FYS3150 at UiO done by Maria Lunde Oftedahl and Karianne Strand.

## Project 1

The topic of the first [project](https://github.com/mariaoftedahl/FYS3150/tree/main/Project_1) is numerical solution of the one-dimensional Poisson equation. 

## Project 2

The topic of the second [project](https://github.com/mariaoftedahl/FYS3150/tree/main/Project_2) is solving eigenvalue problems, using the Jacobi rotation method. 

## Project 3

In [project 3](https://github.com/mariaoftedahl/FYS3150/tree/main/Project_3) we have made a numerical simulation of a Penning trap, using the Runge-Kutta 4 method to solve a system of ordinary differential equations for the Penning trap-system.
