## The Double slit experiment

We have used the Crank Nicolson method to solve the Schr√∂dinger equation in two spatial and one time dimension. This was done to try to simulate results from the Double slit experiment. 

The code is organized in two source files, [functions.cpp](https://github.com/mariaoftedahl/FYS3150/blob/main/Project_5/functions.cpp) and [main.cpp](https://github.com/mariaoftedahl/FYS3150/blob/main/Project_5/main.cpp)  and one header file, [functions.hpp](https://github.com/mariaoftedahl/FYS3150/blob/main/Project_5/functions.hpp) . 

In [functions.hpp](https://github.com/mariaoftedahl/FYS3150/blob/main/Project_5/functions.hpp) we have decleared all functions used in our code, and imported the libraries needed. [functions.cpp](https://github.com/mariaoftedahl/FYS3150/blob/main/Project_5/functions.cpp) contains all the calculations needed, while in [main.cpp](https://github.com/mariaoftedahl/FYS3150/blob/main/Project_5/main.cpp) we have set all initial values. 

To build the code with a Linux terminal, write the following in the command line:

      g++ -O3 -larmadillo -std=c++11 *.cpp -o main.exe
  
To build the code with a MacOS terminal, write the following in the command line:

      g++ -O3 -std=c++11 *.cpp -o main.exe -larmadillo
      
To run the code, in both cases, write

      ./main.exe
